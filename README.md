# Cherry-Score: Unveiling Diversity in German Companies

Welcome to the official repository for the Cherry-Score project developed by our team for the [DataFest Challenge 2023](http://datafest.de/)! In this repository, you will find the code and resources used to analyze data from the German Handelsregister to determine a company's diversity with respect to age and gender. Our project aims to shed light on an essential aspect of the corporate world that has often been overlooked.

## About Cherry-Score

The Cherry-Score is an innovative metric designed by our team to quantify the diversity levels within German companies. By analyzing data from the Handelsregister, we can now assess a company's commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce. The Cherry-Score takes into account the age and gender distribution of excecutives to generate a comprehensive and reliable diversity score.
